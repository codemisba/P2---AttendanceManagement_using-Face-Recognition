# P2---AttendanceManagement_using-Face-Recognition
This project is a Face Recognition-based Attendance System that uses OpenCV, Tkinter, and an SQL database to manage student records and attendance. The system provides functionalities for adding, updating, deleting student details, training the face recognition model, and marking attendance through face recognition.
#FEATURES 
#Student Details Management:
Add, update, or delete student details which are saved directly to the SQL database.
#Face Training:
Capture images of students and train the face recognition model.
#Attendance Marking: 
Once the student's face is recognized, their attendance is marked and stored in a CSV file.
#GUI: Developed using Tkinter for a user-friendly interface.
#TECHNOLOGIES USED 
1. Python 3.11 (Latest stable version of Python)
2. OpenCV (for face detection and recognition)
3. Tkinter (for creating the GUI)
4. SQL Database (to store student details)
5. CSV (to store attendance)
#PREREQUISTIES:
Python 3.11 (latest stable version of Python)
VsCode (latest version)
Alternatively, you can manually install the following libraries:
opencv-python for OpenCV
opencv-contrib-python for additional OpenCV features (like LBPH face recognition)
tkinter for the GUI
